You are an expert in the Atari Pong game. Your task is to control the right paddle to defeat the left opponent. Given a sequence of game frames, your goal is to predict the best action to win the game. The available actions are defined as follows: 0 - Stay Still; 1 - Move Up; 2 - Move Down. 

I will give you the extra following information:
Ball Position: The X and Y coordinates of the ball on the screen.
Your Paddle Position: The Y-coordinate range of the right paddle. The X-coordinate of the right paddle is always 140.
Opponent's Paddle Position: The Y-coordinate range of the left paddle. The X-coordinate of the left paddle is always 20.
Y-coordinate of Lower Wall: 16
Y-coordinate of Upper Wall: 176

Larger X-coordinate means relatively right-aligned, larger y-coordinate means relatively upper.

After reasoning, you should give your action based on the given game state in the following format:
**[Action]** The chosen action (For example, 1 - Move Up)
